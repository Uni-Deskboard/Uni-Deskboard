Overall look for Uni-Deskboard
==============================

Overall, we want our website to look simple and dynamic. For this, we will use a strong, flashy color and contrast
to create a dynamic feel when reading the page. We will also use animated and hoverable buttons for the dynamic feel
and a simple navigation menu for the minimalist feel.

Colors

The colors are very important to show how we feel about our product. The user must feel that Uni-Deskboard is gonna
make his life easier and allow him to work faster. We chose these colors:

-5CCC35

-FFFFFA

Iconogarphy
===========
We will use mostly flat and simple icons which adhere to the minimalist theme and feel.

Typography
===========
We will use Dosis from Google Fonts

Links

Links will not be underlined.

Buttons
=======
The menu buttons will change color (all colors from the ones chosen above) when a user hovers over it and will be flat.
The other buttons ("begin here","more here",etc.) will get bigger when a user hovers over it.
